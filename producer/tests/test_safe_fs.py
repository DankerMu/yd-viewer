# NWM@8ae9b8f2 tests/test_safe_fs.py
"""L1 evidence for `directory_identity_no_follow` (#1192).

What this file proves: the helper consumes **inode identity**, not the input
string.  Every case here runs against a real filesystem, needs no root, and is
portable to Linux (CI, node-27) as well as macOS.

HONEST LIMIT -- read before adding cases.  This layer does **not** prove that
two paths existing *at the same time* under different realpaths report one
identity.  That shape is a bind mount or a second mount point of one export,
and there is no portable, root-free construction for it: directories cannot be
hardlinked, `Path.resolve()` folds symlink aliases away, the no-follow walk
refuses a symlink final component outright, and macOS case-folding aliases are
two distinct directories on Linux.  The rename pair below is **sequential** --
one inode seen at two realpaths one after the other -- not concurrent.  The
guard-level claim was carried upstream by injection tests that are not part
of this snapshot (they exercise NWM copyback/publisher lanes), plus the POSIX
same-superblock argument recorded in the upstream change proposal.

The file also carries safe_fs's **directory-mode determinism** cases (#1513) --
see the section comment below.  Upstream they lived here rather than beside a
sibling suite for CI test-selection reasons; in yd they simply belong to the
safe_fs snapshot.

# `ensure_directory_no_follow` used to call `os.mkdir` with no mode, so the
# landed permission was `0o777 & ~umask` -- a function of the ambient
# environment rather than of the code.  The upstream lock gate is
# fail-closed on any `0o022` bit in the lock's direct parent, so on a
# umask-0002 host (node-27, the project's backend pytest oracle) every
# safe_fs-created lock parent landed `0o775` and was refused.
#
# Both sides are pinned below on purpose: the upstream repository's pre-existing umask
# tests all pin the STRICT side, which is precisely the coverage shape that let
# the permissive-side bug survive.  The `0o077` case is the guard against the
# tempting "fix" of adding an `fchmod` after `mkdir` -- that would clear the
# umask's influence in BOTH directions and silently widen `0o700` to `0o755`.
