# NWM@8ae9b8f2 packages/common/shud_forcing_contract.py
"""Single source of truth for the SHUD forcing package station-index identity.

The direct-grid SHUD forcing package publishes one *main station-index member*
(the ``.tsd.forc`` table listing station rows plus their per-station CSV
filenames). Historically that member was hard-coded as ``shud/qhh.tsd.forc``
for **every** basin, which made a single basin's slug masquerade as a generic
transport name and left 10+ hand-copied string literals across the producer,
the SHUD runtime, the mapping builder, and the QHH diagnostic tooling with no
shared authority to keep them aligned.

This module is that authority (issue #1176, change
``forcing-package-neutral-identity``):

* producers emit **only** :data:`CANONICAL_SHUD_FORCING_INDEX_MEMBER`;
* direct-grid consumers require **exactly one** member of
  :data:`SHUD_FORCING_INDEX_MEMBERS` in both the package manifest and the staged
  filesystem — both members present, or none declared, is fail-closed;
* non-direct-grid staging copies the whole package prefix and may legitimately
  hold a residual second member, so it resolves by the declared member from the
  checksum-verified package manifest's ``files`` list (falling back to the run
  manifest's diagnostic forcing file entries when the package manifest publishes
  none), with canonical-first as the final fallback, and keeps the existing
  internal-forcing fallback when zero members are present;
* either way, historical packages carrying
  :data:`LEGACY_SHUD_FORCING_INDEX_MEMBER` stay readable without ever being
  rewritten;
* the member filename is a pure *transport* identity: it is never evidence of
  which basin the forcing data belongs to, and the runtime still stages it out
  as ``{project}.tsd.forc`` in the model input directory.

Deliberately dependency-free (no imports beyond ``__future__``) so every worker
can consume it without creating an import cycle.
